<h2>1. Food</h2>

<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> <p> Since my <b>culture</b> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language" target="_blank"> Vietnamese </a>,
  I have an interest of eating vietnamese food such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho"> Pho </a>. Pho is my favorite food because<br>
  it becomes good when it's made from stratch. Many Pho resturants makes their broth from scratch because they want their flavor to be<br>
   amazing as it can to pleased their customers and what toppings and noodles they use to make as good as it can.<br></p>

  <li> <p> I also have an interest in Chinese food. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_rice" target="_blank"> Fried Rice </a> is another <br>
    that I eat almost everyday as it is part of my culture. It is the same as eating Pho but Rice has alot of toppings<br>
    such as Corn, Peas, White and Green Onions, Chicken, Carrots, Egg, etc. The dish can be very healthy if<br>
     you choose the right ingredients for it but overall, it is still a good dish to eat!<br></p>
   </ul>

<h2>2. Culture</h2>

<p>Culture is the most important thing that represents you. <i>Culture</i> is <i>the sum of attitudes, customs, and beliefs that<br>
   distinguishes one group of people from another.</i> It shows who you are as a person to others. Each culture is different, since my culture is <br>
   <a href="http://www.vietnam-culture.com/" target="_blank"> Vietnamese</a>, there are many traditions we do that represents us such as food,<br>
    clothing, religion, visual arts, music, holidays, etc., Those traditions is what who we are as a group.</p><br>

<h2>3. Sports</h2>

 <p> <i><b>Sports</b> is what represents my identity. Sports is a way to keep your body active. Not many people are a expert of everything,<br>
      everyone has a different skill of a sport. The two sports that I’m good at are <strong>basketball</strong> and <strong>badminton.</strong></i></p>
        <br>
      <ol>
<li><b>Basketball</b> is my first favorite sport because I have the good height for it. My mom told me if <br>
      I keep drinking milk, sooner or later, I’m going to be so tall that I can dunk on somebody shorter than me!<br>
     And also, Basketball is also a way to prove others that you're not some person that should be messing with.<br>
     Be who you are and people will surely like your skills and ask you to be on their team.</li>

</center>
        <br>
 <li> <b>Badminton</b> is the second sport that I like. Badminton is like playing tennis, but you will be<br>
      dealing with smaller racquets and birdies, instead of bigger racquets and tennis balls.<br>
      I say that badminton is more easier than playing tennis because the object that <br>
     you're hitting is more lighter than a harder object.</li></p>

<h2>4. Math</h2>

<p> <b>Math</b> is now my favorite subject to do since Grade 10. Ever since Grade 5, I started struggling because I have no luck of knowing the concept<br>
     and not knowing what to do with the questions. The reason why is that I am shy and quiet, and I don't feel like asking any questions, but<br>
     my life of math started to change when I had this teacher that is amazing at explaining concepts, so amazing that my fear of asking for<br>
     help is now over. He changed my math and made it easy for me to understand.</p>

      <p><i>That's why asking people for help is important and it's the reason why I am successful and I know what do to in math.</i></p>

<h2>5. Music</h2>

 <p> Last is <b>Music.</b> I love to listen to music because it helps me to relax and calm myself down, it helps me to focus more when<br>
    I'm studying or doing homework. Everyone has a different answer to what is their favorite music. My favorite music is <em>Hip Hop.</em><br>
    I like to listen to rappers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Duo_(South_Korean_duo)" target=_blank>Dynamic Duo </a> and
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)" target=_blank>Drake</a> because they make me feel more relaxed and <br>
     calm when I listen to them, it helps me to focus more when I'm doing my chores, working out, doing homework, everything.</p> <br>
