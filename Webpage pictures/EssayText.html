<center><h2>About Me</h2></center>
  <br>
<center><strong>Welcome to my Webpage!</strong></center>
<br>

  <center><p> Hello! My name is Lewis Tran. I am 17 years old. I'm Vietnamese and I’m in grade 12. I am currently
     learning at a high school called<a href="http://queenelizabeth.epsb.ca/" target="blank" > Queen Elizabeth High School </a>.<br>
I have many hobbies that I loved to do during my free time such as Food, Sports, Video Games, Music.<br>
<!COMMENT
<ol
      <li Food
      <li Sports
      <li Video Games
      <li Music
</ol>
<center>These four hobbies are the type of hobbies that <i>represent</i> my identity because I’m more comfortable with them,<br>
and they’re the hobbies that I’m interested in, and love doing it.</center></p>
<br>

<center><h2> 1. Food </h2></center>
<p> <strong>Food</strong> is what represents my identity. <i>Pho</i> is my favorite food to eat<br>
   because it is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho" target="_blank"> <i> Vietnamese Noodle Soup </i> </a> that <br>
   was first founded in Vietnam. It is the same as other type of noodle soups, but Pho uses rice noodles as the noodle of choice<br>
    because rice noodles are popular in Vietnam, and it has a great flavor,so good that it matches to other food and flavours. <br>
    Pho also has toppings that will make your pho taste amazing. You could order a pho that has: <br>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Green and White onions. </i>
  <li> <i>The meat of choice. </i>
  <li> <i>Bean Sprouts, Basil Leaf. </i>
  <li> <i> Some Spices, Limes, Sauces </i>
</ul>
      <center> <i>Either way, your pho will taste as good as it is<br>
           no matter what toppings you add.</i></p>
      <br></center>

<center><h2> 2. Video Games </h2></center>
<p> <strong>Video games</strong> are another hobby that represents my identity. Once you start playing,<br>
   you will become addicted with it, and become connected with it. Almost many people around the world play video games<br>
    because they think the game they like is a skill<br>
  that they want to master. There are many favorite games I like that are famous around the world.</p>
  <ul>
  <li> An example of a popular game would be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_2" target="_blank"> <i>Destiny 2 </i> </a>
   made by <strong>Bungie</strong> and <strong>Activision</strong>. It became the world’s most popular game around the world<br>
    because it is a first-person shooting-game, where everyone likes a game where they can shoot giant aliens or even<br>
   exploring interesting planets other than earth.</p>

  <br>
    <li> Another example of a popular game is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft" target="_blank"> <i> Minecraft </i> </a> made by <strong>Mojang</strong>. Minecraft is<br>
     a game where you can have a good time building whatever you like in a world where it is just only you building by yourself.<br>
    You can go to <i>survival mode</i> to have an adventure where you can just <br>
    take care of yourself, or go to <i>peaceful mode</i> where you can build whatever you want without anything distracting <br>
    you while you build.</p><br>
   </ul>

<center><h2> 3. Sports </h2></center>
<center><p> <strong>Sports</strong> are also another hobby that represents my identity. <br>
  <i>Not many people are a expert of everything, everyone has a different skill of a sport</i>. The two sports<br>
   that I’m good at are basketball and badminton.</p>
</center>
<br>
  <ol>
<li>I love <b>basketball</b> because I have the good height for it. My mom told me if I keep drinking milk, <br>
  sooner or later, I’m going to be as tall as I can so I can dunk on somebody shorter than me!</p><br>
<li> <b>Badminton</b> is the second sport that I like.<br>
  Badminton is like playing tennis, but you will be dealing with smaller racquets and birdies, instead of bigger racquets<br>
  and tennis balls. Those two sports will always be my favorite sports and I will continue to play with them forever and ever.</p><br>

</center>

<center><h2> 4. Music </h2></center>
<p> <center> <strong>Music</strong> is what I like to listen to. It helps to lighten the mood if I feel like relaxing or forgetting something that<br>
  made me mad or depressed. I like to listen to <strong> K-POP </strong> <i> (Korean Pop Music) </i> meaning music that is in Korea. Ever since<br>
  my cousin showed me K-POP, I fell in love with their music. There are many people I loved to listen in Korean Girl and Boy Groups such as:<br>
<ul>
   <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIXX" > VIXX </a>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS_(band)"> BTS </a>
   <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Pink"> Blackpink </a>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovelyz"> Lovelyz </a>
</ul>
   I fell in love with their music not only because of their looks<br>
   are great, but their voices sounded amazing. Rapping and Hip Hop is also my favorite genre of music in Korea.<br>
   I'm also a fan of Korean Rappers such as:<br>
<ul>
   <li> <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--n6o3Y6nF5k/U8sjXVEtXyI/AAAAAAAACcc/gJ-lKeNmE-0/s1600/201407100756774137_53bdcb49b83ae_99_20140710080903.jpg"
      target="_blank"> Dynamic Duo </a>
   <li> <a href="http://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2016/03/29/20160329001372_0.jpg"
      target="_blank"> DEAN </a>
   <li> <a href="https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/21051427/jay-park-2.jpg"
      target="_blank"> Jay Park </a>
      <li> <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Taeyang_-_MADE_THE_MOVIE_Premiere.jpg"
        target="_blank"> Taeyang </a>
</ul>
  Those four rappers are my favorite because they helped me<br>
  feel relaxed with their music, and their music helps me to focus on my homework at <br>
   or studying for an exam coming up.</p> </center>
